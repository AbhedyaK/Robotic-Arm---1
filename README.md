# Robotic-Arm---1
5 DOF Robotic Arm controlled via Analog Joystick

This project uses 3 Analog Joysticks and 1 static rotation knob used for controlling the gripper/claw.
The analog joysticks are connected to the sensor shield mounted on the arduino and are used for controlling the Base, Shoulder,
Elbow, Wrist servo motors.
This gives the user more precise control over the movements of the robotic arm.
